            h4.subtitle.is-4 Why
            p With so many new cryptocurrencies emerging. It is very timeconsuming to determine which coins are the real deal and which ones are not. Some of them are real and promising but have a huge task ahead before their idea is proven real. This is risky stuff. Rather than promising ridiculous potential future income and capital benefits that so many coins are trying and many eventually failing to do, we offer rational, understandable, real income deriving investment strategies conducted through established mechanism already evident in the crypto markets. The funds we raise will be invested into crypto currencies, so your money won’t be travelling anywhere other than as established in our criteria herein.

            h4.subtitle.is-4 How It Will Work
            p Cycoin is an asset backed coin, back be the pool of cryptocurrencies held. Cycoin holders will receive 51% voting power in the Cycoin company which holds the poll of cryptocurrency (see Coin Democracy). We will hold selected currencies that are established and real (usually in the top 100 by market cap) to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities that arise periodically in the crypto markets and top ten by margin lending currencies. We will also allocate a portion of the fund to invest in curated pre-ICO’s and ICO’s carefully scrutinized and selected by the team and external professionals in the crypto markets.

            h4.subtitle.is-4 Fund Criteria
            p The funds we raise will be invested into coins that are listed on exchanges which provide margin lending facilities, such as Bittrex and Poloniex. Fund will also be invested into arbitrage and another and sufficient trading volume is apparent. A signals app is in development to help identify good arbitrage trades and 5% of the fund will be reserved for development . legal and startup costs. The fund will also invest into select initial offerings of coin called pre-ICO’s and ICO’s. The initial investment of the fund will be to purchase and then lend the pool of coins held through a number of exchanges to immediately start earning income, until arbitrage opportunities are apparent and also while we sort through attractive Pre-ICO and ICO opportunities.

                p For the first month, Initially 100% of the fund (less the development reserve mentioned above), then thereafter, a minimum of 50% and up to 80% of the find will be converted to crypto currencies and placed across a number of exchanges for the purpose of lending those currencies to traders on the exchanges to earn margin lending interest. Margin lending interest differs depending upon the currency and according to supply/demand disparity. They range from .02% per day to 5% per day.
                p We will conver all margin interest earned to bitcoin and ether and distribute this to Cycoin Wallets proportional to the amount of Cycoin held daily.

                p Up to 30% of the fund will be dedicated to talking arbitrage profit. Because cryptocurrentcy exchanges are not interlinked, at times the price pf the same asset may be different on two different exchanges. We will asses these differences and if attractive, take the opportunity to buy the asset at a lower price on one exchange and sell it at a higher price on the other.
                p The price difference is called arbitrage profit and does not involve trying to predict the future updward or downward movement of a currency, as you would if you are trading asset.
